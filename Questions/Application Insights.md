Question: You have a very old Azure function app and you want to integrate it with Application Insights to save informational log data. Which tasks should you perform?

- [ ] Call the `LogInformation` method of the `ILogger` class.
- [ ] Manually enable Application Insights in the function app.
- [ ] Store the name of the instrumentation key in an app setting named `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`.
- [ ] Call the `TrackEvent` method of the `TelemetryClient` class.
- [ ] Disable built-in logging in the function app.
- [ ] Add the Azure App Insights into function App using RBAC.
- [ ] Add the function App into Azure App Insights using RBAC.
- [ ] Add Azure App Insights Service Principle Id to the App settings.
- [ ] Store a key named `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` as a secret named applicationinsights in an Azure Key Vault.

Answer: Application Insights may have to be manually enabled for old functions. To send data, you need the key named `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`. `ILogger` is used to log to Application Insights (not `TelemetryClient`!).  
Azure function apps use app settings to find the Application Insights key, not secrets from the Key Vault.
